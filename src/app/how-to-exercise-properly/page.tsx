                    <p className="article-intro">
                        There are two main types of exercise that most people focus on: aerobic (cardio) and
                        anaerobic (resistance training). Understanding how to do both properly — with correct form,
                        breathing, and structure — is what separates people who get results from those who just
                        go through the motions.

                    <h2 className="section-heading">Step 1: Always Warm Up</h2>
                    <p>
                        Never skip the warm-up. 5-10 minutes of dynamic movement prepares your body for exercise
                        by increasing heart rate, warming your muscles, lubricating joints, and activating your
                        nervous system. A proper warm-up reduces injury risk by up to 50%.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Dynamic Warm-Up Routine (5 minutes):</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Arm circles — 20 forward, 20 backward</li>
                        <li>Leg swings — 15 per leg (front-to-back and side-to-side)</li>
                        <li>Bodyweight squats — 15 reps</li>
                        <li>Walking lunges — 10 per leg</li>
                        <li>Light jog or jumping jacks — 60 seconds</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>Step 2: Master Your Breathing</h2>
                    <p>
                        Proper breathing during exercise is more important than most people realize. For resistance
                        training, the general rule is: <strong>exhale during the effort (concentric phase)</strong> and
                        <strong> inhale during the return (eccentric phase)</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Bench press:</strong> Inhale lowering the bar, exhale pushing it up</li>
                        <li><strong>Squat:</strong> Inhale going down, exhale standing up</li>
                        <li><strong>Pushup:</strong> Inhale lowering yourself, exhale pushing up</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        For cardio, breathe rhythmically through both your nose and mouth. Nose-only breathing
                        limits oxygen intake and won&apos;t sustain higher intensities.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>Step 3: Use Proper Form</h2>
                    <p>
                        Form is everything. Lifting with bad form doesn&apos;t just waste effort — it puts
                        stress on joints and connective tissues instead of muscles, leading to chronic injuries.
                        Key principles that apply to every exercise:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Maintain a neutral spine</strong> — don&apos;t round or hyperextend your back</li>
                        <li><strong>Control the weight</strong> — if you can&apos;t control the descent, it&apos;s too heavy</li>
                        <li><strong>Full range of motion</strong> — partial reps produce partial results</li>
                        <li><strong>Mind-muscle connection</strong> — focus on the target muscle, not just moving weight</li>
                        <li><strong>Don&apos;t use momentum</strong> — swinging weights means your muscles aren&apos;t doing the work</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>Step 4: Structure Your Workout</h2>
                    <p>A well-structured workout follows this template:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Warm-up</strong> (5-10 min) — dynamic movements</li>
                        <li><strong>Compound exercises first</strong> — squats, deadlifts, bench press, rows (when you&apos;re freshest)</li>
                        <li><strong>Isolation exercises second</strong> — bicep curls, leg extensions, lateral raises</li>
                        <li><strong>Cardio or core</strong> (optional, 10-15 min)</li>
                        <li><strong>Cool-down/stretching</strong> (5-10 min) — static stretches, foam rolling</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Total workout time: 45-75 minutes. Anything longer and you&apos;re likely resting too much
                        or doing junk volume that isn&apos;t productive.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>Step 5: Progress Gradually</h2>
                    <p>
                        Progressive overload is the fundamental principle of exercise adaptation. Your body
                        only changes when it&apos;s challenged beyond what it&apos;s accustomed to. Each week, aim for
                        one of these:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add 2.5-5 lbs to the bar (strength)</li>
                        <li>Add 1-2 reps per set (volume)</li>
                        <li>Add 1 set per exercise (volume)</li>
                        <li>Reduce rest time by 10-15 seconds (conditioning)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Don&apos;t try to progress everything at once. Small, consistent improvements compound
                        into massive results over months and years.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>Step 6: Cool Down and Recover</h2>
                    <p>
                        After your workout, spend 5-10 minutes cooling down with light cardio (walking) followed
                        by static stretching. Hold each stretch for 15-30 seconds. This brings your heart rate
                        down gradually, reduces muscle soreness, and improves flexibility over time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recovery extends beyond the gym: sleep 7-9 hours, stay hydrated
                        (<a href="/the-key-benefits-of-drinking-water-during-exercise">water guide</a>),
                        eat adequate protein, and take rest days when needed.
                    </p>
