                        Most people start exercising for one reason: to look better. But the real benefits
                        go far deeper than aesthetics. Regular exercise is the single most powerful thing you
                        can do for your physical health, mental well-being, and longevity. Here&apos;s the evidence.

            <section className="section">
                <div className="container" style={{ maxWidth: '800px' }}>
                    <h2 className="section-heading">1. It Reduces Your Risk of Chronic Disease</h2>
                    <p>
                        Regular exercise reduces the risk of heart disease by up to 35%, type 2 diabetes by 40%,
                        colon cancer by 30%, and breast cancer by 20%. These aren&apos;t small numbers — exercise
                        is more effective than many medications at preventing and managing these conditions. The
                        American Heart Association considers physical inactivity a modifiable risk factor on par
                        with smoking.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>2. It&apos;s the Best Antidepressant That Exists</h2>
                    <p>
                        A 2023 meta-analysis in the <em>British Journal of Sports Medicine</em> found that exercise
                        is 1.5 times more effective than counseling or leading medications for treating depression.
                        Exercise triggers the release of endorphins, serotonin, and BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic
                        factor), which literally grows new brain cells in the hippocampus — the brain region
                        responsible for mood regulation.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>3. It Dramatically Improves Sleep</h2>
                    <p>
                        People who exercise regularly fall asleep faster, sleep more deeply, and wake up feeling
                        more rested. Exercise increases time spent in deep sleep — the most restorative phase.
                        It also reduces symptoms of insomnia and sleep apnea. Just avoid intense exercise within
                        2 hours of bedtime, as the adrenaline can keep you awake.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>4. It Preserves Brain Function as You Age</h2>
                    <p>
                        Exercise is the most evidence-backed intervention for preventing cognitive decline and
                        dementia. Regular cardio exercise increases hippocampal volume (memory center), improves
                        blood flow to the brain, and stimulates BDNF production. Studies show that active adults
                        have 30-40% lower risk of developing Alzheimer&apos;s disease.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>5. It Builds Stronger Bones</h2>
                    <p>
                        Weight-bearing and resistance exercises stimulate bone formation and slow bone density loss.
                        This is critical for preventing osteoporosis, especially for women after menopause. Bones
                        respond to mechanical stress by getting stronger — just like muscles.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>6. It Boosts Energy Levels</h2>
                    <p>
                        It sounds counterintuitive, but expending energy through exercise actually creates more
                        energy. Regular exercise improves mitochondrial function (the powerhouses of your cells),
                        enhances oxygen delivery, and increases your overall metabolic efficiency. People who
                        exercise regularly report 20% more energy and 65% less fatigue than sedentary individuals.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>7. It Adds Years to Your Life</h2>
                    <p>
                        Multiple large-scale studies show that regular moderate exercise adds 3-7 years to your
                        lifespan. Even more impressive: it adds healthy years. Regular exercisers spend fewer years
                        disabled and maintain independence longer. A 2022 study in <em>JAMA Internal Medicine</em> found
                        that 150-300 minutes of moderate exercise per week reduced all-cause mortality by 22-31%.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>8. It Improves Your Skin</h2>
                    <p>
                        Exercise increases blood flow to the skin, delivering oxygen and nutrients while flushing
                        waste products. This gives you a healthier complexion and may slow visible skin aging.

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>9. It Sharpens Focus and Productivity</h2>
                    <p>
                        Exercise improves executive function, working memory, and attention span. A single workout
                        can boost focus for 2-3 hours afterward. This is why many high performers schedule
                        their most important work after morning exercise sessions.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>10. It Builds Discipline That Transfers to Everything</h2>
                    <p>
                        The habit of showing up to exercise — especially on days you don&apos;t feel like it — builds
                        a mental muscle that transfers to every other area of your life. Career, relationships,
                        finances — they all improve when you develop the discipline and self-efficacy that
                        consistent exercise creates.
                    </p>
