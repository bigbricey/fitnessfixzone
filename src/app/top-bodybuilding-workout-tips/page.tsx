                    <h2 className="section-heading">Tip #1: Prioritize Progressive Overload</h2>
                    <p>
                        Progressive overload is the single most important principle in bodybuilding. If you&apos;re
                        not progressively challenging your muscles with more weight, more reps, or more volume
                        over time, you&apos;re not growing — you&apos;re maintaining.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keep a training log. Every session, aim to beat your previous performance by at least one
                        metric. Even adding one rep to one set is progress. These micro-improvements compound
                        into massive gains over months.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>Tip #2: Train Each Muscle 2x Per Week</h2>
                    <p>
                        Research consistently shows that training each muscle group twice per week produces
                        significantly more growth than once per week, even when total volume is equalized.
                        Muscle protein synthesis (MPS) peaks 24-48 hours after training — training once weekly
                        means MPS is elevated for only 2 of 7 days. Training twice weekly doubles that window.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Best splits for 2x frequency:</strong> Push/Pull/Legs (6 days), Upper/Lower (4 days),
                        or Full Body (3 days).
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>Tip #3: Train Close to Failure</h2>
                    <p>
                        Research from 2022-2024 shows that training within 1-3 reps of muscular failure (known as
                        &quot;reps in reserve&quot; or RIR) is optimal for hypertrophy. Going to absolute failure
                        on every set creates excessive fatigue that limits volume. Leaving 5+ reps undone leaves
                        gains on the table.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The sweet spot:</strong> Most working sets at RIR 1-2 (1-2 reps left in the tank).
                        Save true failure sets for the last set of an exercise.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>Tip #4: Control the Eccentric</h2>
                    <p>
                        The eccentric (lowering) phase of an exercise creates more muscle damage than the concentric
                        (lifting) phase — and muscle damage is one of three key drivers of hypertrophy. Lowering
                        the weight over 2-3 seconds maximizes this stimulus while also increasing time under tension.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Practical rule:</strong> 1-2 seconds to lift, 2-3 seconds to lower. If you&apos;re
                        dropping the weight, you&apos;re leaving gains on the table.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>Tip #5: Optimize Your Exercise Order</h2>
                    <p>
                        Always train your weakest or most important muscle group first when you&apos;re freshest.
                        The general order should be:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Compound movements</strong> (squats, bench, rows) — require the most energy and coordination</li>
                        <li><strong>Compound accessories</strong> (dumbbell press, lunges, cable rows) — moderate demand</li>
                        <li><strong>Isolation exercises</strong> (curls, extensions, lateral raises) — least demanding</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>Tip #6: Track Your Optimal Volume</h2>
                    <p>
                        Current research suggests these weekly volume ranges for hypertrophy (sets per muscle group):
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Minimum effective volume:</strong> 6-8 sets/week</li>
                        <li><strong>Maximum adaptive volume:</strong> 15-20 sets/week</li>
                        <li><strong>Maximum recoverable volume:</strong> 20-25 sets/week (advanced only)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Start at the lower end and increase only when progress stalls. More volume isn&apos;t
                        always better — it&apos;s only better if you can recover from it.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>Tip #7: Use Rest Periods Strategically</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Strength/compound lifts:</strong> 2-5 minutes (full neural recovery)</li>
                        <li><strong>Hypertrophy:</strong> 60-120 seconds (metabolic stress + adequate recovery)</li>
                        <li><strong>Pump/isolation work:</strong> 30-60 seconds (maximize metabolic stress)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Time your rest periods. Most people rest too long on isolation work and too short on compound
                        lifts — the exact opposite of what&apos;s optimal.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--space-2xl)' }}>Tip #8: Vary Your Rep Ranges</h2>
                    <p>
                        While the 8-12 rep range is the hypertrophy sweet spot, periodically training in other
                        ranges stimulates different muscle fibers and adaptation pathways:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1-5 reps (heavy):</strong> Builds strength, which lets you lift more in hypertrophy ranges</li>
                        <li><strong>6-12 reps (moderate):</strong> Primary hypertrophy zone — spend most of your time here</li>
                        <li><strong>12-20+ reps (light):</strong> Metabolic stress, great for isolation and pump work</li>
                    </ul>
