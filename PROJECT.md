## ⚡ Marcus Campbell Strategy: The "Jugular" Approach

### CORE PRINCIPLE: Don't sell cheap stuff for tiny commissions.
One high-ticket ClickBank sale at $40-47 > dozens of Amazon sales at $0.50 each.

### What We're Selling (Priority Order)

**1. PRIMARY: High-Ticket ClickBank Offers (50-75% commission)**
- **Vert Shock / Jump Manual** — $40-47/sale (vertical jump training)
- **Smoothie Diet / Weight Loss Recipes** — high mass appeal
- **Running Programs** (e.g., Run Dream Achieve) — $77/sale at 40% commission
- **Supplements** — Fit Espresso, Lean Belly Juice (high CPA payouts)
- Look for: 50-75% commission, $30+ payout, recurring billing if available

**2. SECONDARY: Amazon Associates (Low priority)**
- Physical gear only (dumbbells, shoes, mats, resistance bands)
- Use as supplementary income on gear review articles
- DO NOT build the site around Amazon — commissions too low (1-4%)

**3. TERTIARY: Email List (Long-term backend)**
- Free "Fitness Fix" PDF as lead magnet (NOT a product to sell — use as bonus)
- Email list allows repeated marketing of multiple offers over time
- The "backend" is where the real money lives

### The "Bonus" Play (Marcus's Key Insight)
Instead of selling the PDF workout plan directly:
- Offer it as a **FREE BONUS** to anyone who buys the ClickBank product through our link
- This increases conversion rate because we add value competitors don't
- Example: "Buy Vert Shock through our link → Get our FREE Custom Jump Training PDF"

## Content Strategy (Niche DOWN)

### Sub-Niche Options (Pick ONE to Start)
Marcus says "fitness" is too broad. Pick a specific problem:
- **Option A:** Vertical jump / basketball training → Vert Shock affiliate
- **Option B:** Weight loss / smoothie recipes → Smoothie Diet affiliate
- **Option C:** Running performance → Run Dream Achieve affiliate
- **Option D:** Home gym / workout routines → Multiple fitness offers

### Content Types
1. **Rebuilt Historical Content** — Check what domain ranked for before, recreate those pages
2. **"Fix" Guides** — "5 Mistakes People Make When Trying to Lose Weight" (bridge pages to offers)
3. **Tools/Calculators** — BMI calculator, calorie deficit calculator (HIGH conversion, bookmarkable)
4. **"Best of" Reviews** — "Best Shoes for Jumping Higher" (Amazon + ClickBank hybrid)

### Target: 50 Pages of Content
Marcus sells rebuilt domains with ~50 pages for $1,500. Our content plan:
- 10 cornerstone "Fix" guides (bridge pages → affiliate offers)
- 15 "Best of" review articles (gear + supplement roundups)
- 5 tool pages (calculators, trackers)
- 10 informational articles (how-to guides, tips)
- 10 supporting pages (about, contact, disclaimer, category pages)

## First 30 Days — DON'T WAIT FOR GOOGLE

### Week 1: Build
- [ ] Scaffold site (Next.js, premium design, NOT AI slop)
- [ ] Build 1 interactive tool (Calorie Calculator or BMI Calculator)
- [ ] Write 5 bridge pages with ClickBank affiliate links
- [ ] Create lead magnet PDF

### Week 2: Launch & Press
- [ ] Issue press release: "FitnessFixZone launches AI-Powered Fitness Calculator"
- [ ] Submit to Google Search Console
- [ ] Write 5 more content pages

### Weeks 3-4: Traffic Drivers
- [ ] Post "Reaction" videos on TikTok/Instagram (react to viral workout fails)
- [ ] Create fitness infographics for Pinterest/Facebook groups
- [ ] Post in Reddit fitness communities (value-first, not spammy)
- [ ] Optional: Run small paid traffic test to tool page ($50-100 budget)

## Design Philosophy: Premium, NOT AI Slop
**Marcus says ugly sites convert. That was before AI. We're in 2026.**
- Use the `frontend-design` skill for distinctive, non-generic design
- Avoid: default AI color palettes, generic stock photos, cookie-cutter layouts
- Use: custom color harmony, real typography (Inter, Outfit), micro-animations
- Feel: Like a premium fitness brand (think: Peloton blog, not WordPress template)
- Research anti-AI-slop design patterns before building

## Revenue Projections
| Timeframe | Strategy | Revenue Target |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Month 1 | Social traffic → ClickBank offers | $0-200 |
| Month 2-3 | SEO starting + paid tests | $200-1,000 |
| Month 4-6 | Organic kicking in + email list | $500-2,000 |
| Month 6-12 | Full organic + backend | $1,000-5,000 |

## Key Marcus Quotes to Remember
- "The best offer is simply the one that fits your traffic the best"
- "Zero gravity can be good — you can clean house with zero-gravity products"
- "Don't get hung up on gravity. Focus on how well the offer matches your audience's intent"
- "Use the PDF as a bonus, not a product"
